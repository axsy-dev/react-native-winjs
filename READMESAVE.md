# React Native WinJS

> A framework for building WinJS apps with a React Native compatible API.

## Adding to an existing React Native project

If you already have a React Native project and want to add web support, you need to execute the following commands in your existing project directory:

1. Install `npm install react-web-cli -g`
2. Execute `react-web init <ExistedProjectDir>` that install `react-web` and `devDependencies` to your project and make a `web` directory with `webpack.config.js` file under your project
3. Execute `react-web start` that starts the web dev server
4. Execute `react-web bundle` that builds the output

## Getting Started

### Install

```sh
npm install react-web --save
```

### Add Webpack configuration

Inside your webpack configuration, alias the `react-native` package to the `react-web` package, then install and add [haste-resolver-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yuanyan/haste-resolver-webpack-plugin) plugin.

```js
// webpack.config.js
var HasteResolverPlugin = require('haste-resolver-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'react-native': 'react-web'
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    new HasteResolverPlugin({
      platform: 'web',
      nodeModules: ['react-web']
    })
  ]
}
```

> See more detail of the `webpack.config.js` from [React Native Web Example](https://github.com/yuanyan/react-native-web-example/blob/master/web/webpack.config.js)

#### What does HasteResolverPlugin do?

When using components of `react-web`, just `require('ReactActivityIndicator')`, and Webpack will build a bundle with `ActivityIndicator.web.js` for web platform.

`HasteResolverPlugin` will do the following for you:

1. Walk over all components and check out the `@providesModule` info.
2. When webpack build bundle, it makes your components recognised rather than throwing an error.
3. It will help webpack build bundle with correct file depending on the tar* platform.

You can find something like `@providesModule ReactActivityIndicator` on `react-web` component's comment, yes, it's for `HasteResolverPlugin`.

### Require modules

#### The CommonJS way

```js
var React = require('react-native');
var {
  AppRegistry,
  StyleSheet,
  View,
  Platform,
} = React;
```

This reference method looks like we're in the way of using the native react-native way:

Like the require module in Node.js, and through [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), allows some components to be referenced in the scope of the current file.

But in fact it is quite different in React Web.
When `require('react-native')`, in the construction of the webpack will be renamed, equivalent to `require('react-web')`.

At the same time, this form of writing will put all the components into at one time, including `ReactAppRegistry` `ReactView` and so on, even some components the you did not use.

#### The Haste way

```js
var AppRegistry = require('ReactAppRegistry');
var View = require('ReactView');
var Text = require('ReactText');
var Platform = require('ReactPlatform');
```

In this way, we load our components on demand, such as `ReactAppRegistry` or `ReactView` and so on.

Packaged components so that we no longer need to care about the differences between the platform.

As mentioned above, the HasteResolverPlugin plugin will help webpack to compile and package the code.

### Fix platform differences

1. Native events without direct pageX/pageY on web platform
  ```js
  if (Platform.OS == 'web') {
    var touch = event.nativeEvent.changedTouches[0];
    pageX = touch.pageX;
    pageY = touch.pageY;
  } else {
    startX = event.nativeEvent.pageX;
    startY = event.nativeEvent.pageY;
  }
  ```

2. Should run application on web platform
  ```js
  AppRegistry.registerComponent('Game2048', () => Game2048);
  if(Platform.OS == 'web'){
    var app = document.createElement('div');
    document.body.appendChild(app);
    AppRegistry.runApplication('Game2048', {
      rootTag: app
    })
  }
  ```

3. Should care about fetch domain on web platform
  ```js
  var fetch = Platform.OS === 'web'? require('ReactJsonp'): require('ReactFetch');
  ```

4. Component without setNativeProps method on web platform
  ```js
  var setNativeProps = require('ReactSetNativeProps')
  setNativeProps(this.refs.foo, {
    style: {
      top: 0
    }
  })
  ```

5. Without some APIs like `LayoutAnimation` on web platform
  ```js
  var LayoutAnimation = require('ReactLayoutAnimation')
  if(Platform.OS !== 'web'){
    LayoutAnimation.configureNext(...)
  }
  ```
